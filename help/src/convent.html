However, there are two exceptions:<br>1) any word in <b>bold</b> is a keyword and as such part of the syntax. Words that are not bold must be substituted by an appropriate value.<br>2) (repeatable) means that the previous term in the syntax may be repeated and the repeat should start with a comma. Example: 'column_name (repeatable)' is the same as 'column_name [, column_name]...' so this can written as 'a, b' or 'a, b, c' etc. {some_text} (repeatable) means that the syntax description between the curly braces {} may be repeated and the repeat should start with a comma.<br>Hyperlinked words point to a detailed syntax description, so instead of using the hyperlinked word you should use (a part of) the underlying detailed syntax description.<br></body></html>
