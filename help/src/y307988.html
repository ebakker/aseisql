Total density represents the average number of duplicates for all values, those in both frequency and range cells. Total density is used to estimate the number of matching rows for joins and for search arguments whose value is not known when the query is optimized.  It also updates the total density of any composite column statistics for which this column is the leading attribute. Most commonly, a composite index for which this column is the leading attribute would produce these composite column statistics, but they can also be produced when you issue a composite update statistics command.</td></tr></table></body></html>
