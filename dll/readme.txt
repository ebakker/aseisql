here will be stored compiled dlls
and some pb10 dlls required to assemble installation.

the dll xxsyc.dll is an original modified pb dll
to prevent unnecessary sql code executed on connection.
that's to do connection to old ASE (11.x), ASA, IQ, REPSERVER.
actually ASA,IQ, and REPSERVER are not supported, but maybe in the future...


for pb libraries i need somebody who can make binary diff patch from mine version
to original. //that's because i can't publish them.
a binary patch tool required.
